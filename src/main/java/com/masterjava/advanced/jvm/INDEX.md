## üí° KEY CONCEPTS AT A GLANCE

**Stack Memory:**
- Per-thread, ~1MB each
- Stores primitives and references
- Automatically freed when method returns
- Very fast (no GC overhead)

**Heap Memory:**
- Shared across threads
- Stores all objects and arrays
- Managed by garbage collector
- Larger size (512MB - 32GB default)

**Garbage Collection:**
- Mark phase: Find reachable objects
- Sweep phase: Free unreachable objects
- Compact phase: Defragment memory
- Generational: Focus on Young Gen (90% objects die there)

**5 Memory Optimization Patterns:**
1. Object pooling
2. Lazy initialization
3. String interning
4. Primitive arrays over objects
5. Bounded caches with eviction
