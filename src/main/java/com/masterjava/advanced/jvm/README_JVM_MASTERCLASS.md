## üîç Quick Reference - Key Concepts

### Stack Memory
- **Per-thread:** Each thread gets its own stack
- **LIFO:** Last-In-First-Out (methods pushed/popped)
- **Auto-freed:** When method returns, frame destroyed
- **Size:** ~1MB per thread (typical)
- **Contents:** Primitive values, object references, method frames

### Heap Memory
- **Shared:** All threads share one heap
- **GC-managed:** Garbage collector handles allocation/deallocation
- **Size:** 512MB - 32GB (configurable)
- **Contents:** All objects and arrays
- **Regions:** Young (Eden, S0, S1), Old, Metaspace

### Garbage Collection
- **Mark Phase:** Identify reachable objects from GC roots
- **Sweep Phase:** Free unmarked objects
- **Compact Phase:** Defragment memory
- **Generational:** Focus on Young Gen (90% objects die there)
- **Algorithms:** Serial, Parallel, CMS, G1GC, ZGC

### Memory Optimization
- **Object Pooling:** Reuse frequent objects
- **Lazy Init:** Delay expensive resource creation
- **String Interning:** Share duplicate strings
- **Primitive Arrays:** 10x less memory than object collections
- **Bounded Caches:** Prevent unbounded growth

## üéì Interview Success Tips

When asked JVM/Memory questions:

1. **Start Simple**

   - Progress to complexity (GC algorithms)
   
2. **Use Diagrams**
   - Draw ASCII diagrams while explaining
   - Visualize memory states
   - Show before/after scenarios

3. **Provide Code**
   - Give concrete examples
   - Show good vs bad practices
   - Explain line by line

4. **Discuss Tradeoffs**
   - "There's no one-size-fits-all"
   - "It depends on your workload"
   - "We measured and found..."

5. **Reference Production**
   - "In my last role, we..."
   - "We used JProfiler to..."
   - "Our monitoring showed..."

6. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
   - "What's the heap size requirement?"
   - "What's your latency target?"
   - "What's the data volume?"
